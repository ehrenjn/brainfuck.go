Brainfuck is a classic esoteric programming language, designed to be difficult to use. To find out more visit https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck  

## Usage
First, compile brainfuck.go  
Then, to start the brainfuck interpreter simply open up command prompt or bash and execute:  
```
brainfuck
```
If you want to interpret a file just add the filename at the end of the command  
For example, to interpret a file called "filename":  
```
brainfuck filename
```
or, if you would like the output to be chars instead of ints:  
```
brainfuck filename -s
```
